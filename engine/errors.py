"""Plain-language errors.

Every failure the final user can see must answer four questions:

1. what happened (plain language);
2. is previously trusted data still safe;
3. what is the one next action;
4. what support code identifies the problem.

Technical detail is kept in ``detail`` and is only shown collapsed.
